This "rehash" of Sam Stephenson work (please see LICENSE) was done with Google App Script in mind.

All references to browser globals such as window and document have been removed: Google App Script has no knowledge of these global variables.
All DOM related functionalities have been removed as well for Google App Script browser-less environment.

A standard and a minified build have been provided for convenience in the dist directory, as well as the YUI compressor used to build the compressed version of this library.
Please find the build.xml ant file in this project root: it may be used to generate both distribution files.

Many thanks to Sam Stephenson, who built one of the first cross browser ECMAScript library.  It's quite a feat to design and implement such a fundamental library and in
such a way that it would prove useful across so many platforms, even in Google's cloud, 6 years after it was first released.
